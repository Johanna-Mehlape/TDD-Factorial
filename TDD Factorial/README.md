This is a project based on Test Driven Development(TDD). A function was created to find the factorial of a given integer but first before the function was created a there had to be a test written (unit test)prior to the actual function/program, which is basically the whole idea of TDD.

What one should expect from the function is that, it is supposed to fail an empty input, it is also supposed to deal with non-numeric and negative inputs by giving an error message. For inputs 1 and 0 it should produce 1 as a result/factorial and for all other positive integers, it should also be able to produce the factorials of those numbers. The only challenge will be for larger numbers > 999, it won't be able to produce any output but a RuntimeError message.
